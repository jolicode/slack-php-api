# A PHP client for Slack's API

There is a bunch of PHP clients for Slack. But some are not up to date or miss
features, some only cover a small part of the API and most are simply no longer
maintained.

This SDK is generated automatically with [JanePHP](https://github.com/janephp/janephp)
from the [official Slack API specs](https://github.com/slackapi/slack-api-specs). It provide a fully object oriented interface for all the endpoints, requests and responses of the Slack Web API.

## Installation

This library is built atop of [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) and
[PSR-18](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-18/). So you will need to install some
implementations for those interfaces.

If no PSR-18 client or PSR-7 message factory is available yet in your project
or you don't know or don't care which one to use, just install some default:

```bash
composer require symfony/http-client nyholm/psr7
```

You can now install the Slack client:

```bash
composer require jolicode/slack-php-api
```

## Usage

First, you need to retrieve a token - like an OAuth AccessToken or a legacy
token. Checkout Slack's documentation about [all differents kind of tokens](https://api.slack.com/docs/token-types).

Then, use the factory that is provided to create the client:

```php
// $client contains all the methods to interact with the API
$client = JoliCode\Slack\ClientFactory::create($yourToken);

$user = $client->usersInfo(['user' => 'U123AZER'])->getUser();

dump($user);
```

## Troubleshoots

Got some problems using this library? Need a missing feature?
Do not hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/jolicode/slack-php-api/issues)
and share it with us.

### Missing data in the DTO?

The Slack specification is not up to date and miss some critical parts. We do
build a [better one on top of the official](doc/updating-sdk.md) but it can't
be perfect.

What's good is that some models use `\ArrayObject` as base classes so if the
API returns data we don't have in the mapping, you can still access it via
Array like syntax:

```php
$results = $client->searchMessages([
    'query' => 'test'
]);

var_dump($results->getOk()); // Mapped
var_dump($results['messages']); // Not mapped but still readable
```

Feel free to open issues for those missing fields.
